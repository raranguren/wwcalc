Hosting a game of [Werewolf](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_deduction_game) for your online community can be challenging. Not only you need to apply the rules correctly, keep track of deadlines for each round, of the votes during the day phase, and of the effects during the night phase, but it is also your responsibility as the game master to prepare a setup that is fun for most people.

Those who have played many games of Werewolf might remember games in which the wolves had it too easy, or on the contrary, they had no chance. While those games can be fun, the principle of these kind of games is to prove that **an informed minority has advantage over an uninformed majority**. 

This simulator tries to show, in a simplified way, the effects that the different team sizes can have, so that you, as the game master, can make an informed decision.

Try to balance the amount of roles so that the village has a slight advantage but the wolves can still win.
